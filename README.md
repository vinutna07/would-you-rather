# Would You Rather Project

Leverage the strengths of Redux to build a "Would You Rather" application where users are given questions and must choose one of them. You’ll build this dynamic application from scratch while combining the state management features of Redux and component model of React. When complete, you’ll be able to create your own sets of questions, choose between them, and keep track of question popularity.



## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
